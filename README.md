# Embedded-C-ATmega8-
Embedded C is one of the most popular and most commonly used Programming Languages in the development of Embedded Systems. Embedded C is perhaps the most popular languages among Embedded Programmers for programming Embedded Systems. There are many popular programming languages like Assembly, BASIC, C++ etc. that are often used for developing Embedded Systems but Embedded C remains popular due to its efficiency, less development time and portability.
DDRC = 0b11101111; – sets Pin 27 of ATmega8 as input
This means PC4 of ATMega8 is assigned as an input point.
PC4 is Pin 27 of the MCU
PORTC = 0b00010000; – this Enables internal pullup of pin 27
